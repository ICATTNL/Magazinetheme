# Magazinetheme
This is a DNN skin + 2SXC apps to create and easily manage story telling websites

To start:
You have DNN 7 or 8 running.
You have the 2SXC module (https://github.com/2sic/2sxc) installed

Installing the Magazine theme:
Copy the skin folder to your Portals/_default/Skins folder
Copy the container folder to your Portals/_default/Containers folder
Import the apps through the 2SXC UI

The Masthead app offers the ability to display a video background.
If you have multiple formats, name them the same and offer a jpg (with the same name) for fall back. All in the same folder.

On a DNN 7 install + 2SXC 7.2.3 some apps throw messages after importing but they work just as well.
